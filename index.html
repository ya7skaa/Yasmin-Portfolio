    <div class=" me">
      <p>My name is Yasmin Abdirahman.<p>
          <p>I am a 23 year old muslim woman. I study at moringa school ,(which is a coding school)</p>
          <p><span class="education"> For my primary education I attended Riara Road Primary School and attended St.George's Girls'Secondary School for high school.</span></p>
          <p> For the past 2 years I attended the University of Nairobi.</p>
          <p>I was persuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The main reason why I decided to take up a class in coding is because I've always been interested in doing computers and the science behind it.</P>
    <p> I wanted to learn the art behind creating apps and websites.</p>
    <p> Here are a few projects I worked on in my fisrt week at Moringa School:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="file:///Users/ya7ska/Documents/moringa-school-projects/pet-website/index.html">Pet Website</a></li>
      <li><a href="file:///Users/ya7ska/Documents/moringa-school-projects/resort-website/index.html">Resort Website</a></li>
    </ol>

    <p>One of my favorite things to do is creating videos.I make vidoes on YouTube all about lifestyle, fashion and beauty.</p>
