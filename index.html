      <p>I am a 23 year old muslim woman. I study at moringa school ,(which is a coding school)</p>
      <p> For the past 2 years i attended the University of Nairobi.</p>
      <p>I was persuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.</p>
      <p>The main reason why I decided to take up a class in coding is because I've always been interested in doing computers and the science behind it.</P>
      <p> I wanted to learn the art behind creating apps and websites.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Swimming.</li>
        <li>Watching movies.</li>
        <li>Going out with friends.</li>
      </ul>
